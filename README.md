# NonProfDev

## Description
NonProfDev is a platform that connects nonprofits with student developers, with the intent of having the students volunteer their time and technical skills toward completing a meaningful, real-world project. Developers can create a profile and post their technical skills / experiences on the site, while nonprofits can post available projects for potential developers to work on.
